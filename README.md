# Skyfish image slider

## Delivery

* decided to write it in vanilla js, so no build steps are required. (should still be ran through some build process for backwards compatibilities)
* written as modules (custom elements), that way the code is organized almost the same as if it was written in vue or react ect.
* only tested in Chrome 66 on MacOS

## How to use

* spin up a local web server and navigate to the index file

## Have no local server? Install local web server

* npm i -g http-server
* cd ~/project-location/
* http-server . -p 7777
* open chrome; navigate to: 127.0.0.1:7777
